      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p class="about"> My name is Justin Smith, I am from Bloomfield, CT and I am an aspiring programmer.
       I have always had a strong passion for computer systems and hardware, but recently 
       I have had my sights set on what makes these systems, and the applications we use everyday, run on a software level. 
       Outside of honing my skills as a programmer, 
       you can find me improving myself in the gym, playing my favorite games, or in my backyard shooting my bow.
