My challenge #2 is a portfolio page that represents my progress in making a career in web development. This page consists of examples of my work so far, a short bio about myself as well as contact information such as phone number, email, linkedin and github. 
There are also included images of myself, a picture of my computer and record collection. I have also included icons of the different contact methods I can be reached from
I used CSS pages to change positions, colors, fonts as well as adapting the site for different window sizes.
There is navigation functionality for the buttons at the top of the screen as well as effects on hover for various elements throughout the page.
I included tooltips on images
